    <h2>Section one</h2>
    <p>Mountains are more than just large landforms; they are significant features of the Earth's surface that influence climate and biodiversity, and support human life. Many are part of vast mountain ranges like the Andes, Alps, and Himalayas, which can stretch for hundreds or thousands of kilometers. Some mountains, particularly at higher elevations, are perpetually covered in snow and ice, forming massive glaciers that serve as sources for many of the world's major rivers.

        <p>Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better" is a quote, often attributed to Albert Einstein, that encourages a deep, observational, and insightful approach to the natural world to gain a deeper understanding of life and the universe. This concept suggests that by observing natural phenomena, patterns, and processes, one can develop wisdom, find inspiration, and achieve greater clarity on fundamental truths and interconnectedness in all aspects of life.
